# Firebase Asynchronous Write Failure

This repository demonstrates a problem encountered with asynchronous writes to the Firebase Realtime Database.  The `set()` method seemingly completes successfully, yet the data fails to appear in the database.  The issue is not related to simple timing delays, as significant wait times have been observed without resolving the problem.  The `bug.js` file contains the original code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a resolution.

## Problem

The problem lies in a misunderstanding of how asynchronous operations behave with Firebase. The `then()` block executes immediately upon the *promise* resolving (meaning the write *operation* initiated successfully), not necessarily when the data is *actually* persisted in the database.  Network connectivity and database server-side factors can cause delays.

## Solution

The solution involves either employing listeners to confirm data persistence, or using transactions to ensure atomicity and data integrity.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides examples of these approaches.
